tillerless-helm-release-exporter is a simple service that queries the Secrets and ConfigMaps in all namespaces and generates metrics about the helm releases.
The exposed metrics can be found here:
https://github.com/bergerx/tillerless-helm-release-exporter/#collected-metrics

The metrics are exported on the HTTP endpoint /metrics on the listening port.
In your case, {{ template "tillerless-helm-release-exporter.fullname" . }}.{{ .Release.Namespace }}.svc.cluster.local:{{ .Values.service.port }}/metrics

Get the application URL by running these commands:
  echo "Visit http://127.0.0.1:8080 to use your application"
  kubectl port-forward -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} svc/{{ template "tillerless-helm-release-exporter.fullname" . }} 8080:80
